Sports Bar is a sports news website arranged in a series of stacked horizontal bars Ð using custom Javascript and CSS, the user can scroll through large amounts of data very quickly.  While the website does not contain any ads at the moment, they could simply be embedded as tiles within any of the bars on the page, removable with the purchase of a premium account.Just to explain Ð the U-Bar is a personalized bar that follows you around the website, giving you immediate access to a set of your favorite links.f.  The website has been tested on Google Chrome Ð to ensure highest quality, it would be best to view the project on that browser.  Also, the fonts on the website get messed up for some reason if the user has a local copy of the Segoe UI Light font on their computer.
